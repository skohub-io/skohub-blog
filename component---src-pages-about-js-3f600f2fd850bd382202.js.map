The general idea is to extend \r\n      the scope of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) to also act as communication hubs for publishers \r\n      and information seekers. In effect, SkoHub allows to follow specific subjects in order to be notified \r\n      when new content about that subject is published.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      The approach is realized by putting Knowledge Organization Systems online according to the SKOS \r\n      standard. Additionally, they are exposed using the (social) networking protocols\r\n      {` `}\r\n      <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\">ActivityPub</a>\r\n      {` `}and{` `}\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/\">Linked Data Notifications</a>\r\n      . This effectively turns the published vocabularies into hubs that provide structured metadata \r\n      about and links to web content in real time.  \r\n      </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>\r\n      The project to create a production-ready version of SkoHub has been carried out by the\r\n      {` `}\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.hbz-nrw.de/\">North-Rhine Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz)</a>\r\n      {` `}\r\n      in cooperation with\r\n      {` `}\r\n      <a href=\"http://graphthinking.com/\">graphthinking GmbH</a>\r\n      {` `}\r\n      with four deliverables. The core is the back end infrastructure for publishing vocabularies \r\n      on the web (Skohub Vocabs) and for receiving and pushing notifications (SkoHub PubSub). \r\n      Additionally, we provide an editor to describe web resources according to a common metadata \r\n      schema and to send notifications (SkoHub Editor). The editor can also be used as a browser \r\n      plugin for Firefox and Chrome (SkoHub Extension).\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About\r\n\r\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\r\n  query {\r\n    site {\r\n      siteMetadata {\r\n        title\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`"],"names":["data","location","siteTitle","site","siteMetadata","title","className","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
