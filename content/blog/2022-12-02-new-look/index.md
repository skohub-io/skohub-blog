We are happy to announce the new SkoHub logo and design we have deployed right in time for our [SWIB22 workshop](https://swib.org/swib22/programme.html#day3) on Wednesday! In the last months, Kai Mertens and effective WEBWORK helped to work out this new look in the context of the [project we have announced earlier](https://blog.skohub.io/2022-05-eww-project-kickoff/). We have now updated the [SkoHub website](https://skohub.io), this blog and the default [SkoHub Vocabs](https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-vocabs) setup to incorporate the new logo and design.

Here is an [example](https://w3id.org/kim/hochschulfaechersystematik/scheme) of how a vocabulary built with SkoHub Vocabs will look now with this default design:

I looks much clearer and more modern than before. We also love the new logo. Kai did a great job creating the new logo and design while not totally breaking with the previous look. We created an extra repo at [https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-logo](https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-logo) for the logo and related files. In the next days, we will add some more documentation, especially on [how to configure a customized version for your own SkoHub Vocabs instance](https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-vocabs/issues/188#issuecomment-1327321911).
